# Generate a python dictionnary file from the xkcd list of colours

The purpose of this script is to automate the generation of a python dictionnary file from the XKCD color definition (https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/)
Ultimatly I'd like to use this dictionnary to complete the list of defines colours in the Python colour module (https://pypi.org/project/colour/)
Pull request pending.
